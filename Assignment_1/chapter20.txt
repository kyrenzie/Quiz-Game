Can Fuzzy MAtrices be used without multiplying the input memberships? Why or why not?
No, it is absolutely necessary to multiply the input memberships.
Yes, but only after negating the matrix.
Yes, it is possible using AND and OR operators, and then randomly selecting action for the active cel.
Yes, it is possible using XOR and NOT operators after multiplying the matrix.
